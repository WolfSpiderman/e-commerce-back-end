## Description

The goal of this project was to finish the back-end routes for an e-commerce site. I was tasked with writing in the routes for viewing, adding, updating, and deleting categories, products, and tags for products.  I got a lot more experience with writing api routes, as well as getting some fairly new experience with working with put and delete methods.

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed, as well as express, and you will want to fork and pull this repo.

## Usage

Once you have the app in your local repository, install the packages with npm i, create the database in mySQL, run npm run seed, and then npm start. You will now be able to use the various routes in Insomnia. The get and post routes will be at /api/categories, /api/products, and /api/tags. To use the single get, put, and delete routes, add /:id to your request parameters.
